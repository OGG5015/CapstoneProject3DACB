APERAT - Free Font. Aperat is a Cyberpunk inspired display font. The whole font is created in a futuristic look. Every letter has the same width so the font is perfect for vertical typography. You can use Aperat in both your personal and commercial projects, just link me your project, I'm stoked to see what other creatives can do with my font. Go make some great stuff!
Cheers,
